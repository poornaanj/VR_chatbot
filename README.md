Creating a Conversational Agent (Chatbot) for VicRoads Licensing and Registration Services

This project focuses on developing a conversational agent (chatbot) designed to provide users with instant, accurate answers to frequently asked questions about VicRoads licensing and registration services. All information is sourced from the official VicRoads website (https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/), and the data ownership remains with VicRoads.

The primary goal is to demonstrate the significant value and convenience that a chatbot can offer in enhancing the user experience. By integrating this chatbot into the website, users can easily access critical information, reducing the time spent navigating through the site and improving overall satisfaction. This project showcases how a well-designed conversational agent can streamline access to services, offering a more efficient and user-friendly interaction with VicRoads services.

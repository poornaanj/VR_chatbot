        "Question": "How secure is a digital driver licence?\n",
        "Answer": "The security of your private information is our top priority. Your digital driver licence will be secure in the app. It can only be seen by you and whoever you choose to share it with. To protect your privacy, you decide if you want to share all - or just some - of your licence data. You control the personal information you share with licence verifiers based on why you are using it. \nThere are 3 levels of info that you can share with your digital driver licence:\nFull licence: This view shows info about your right to drive. You can share this view when you need to show police things like licence status, classes, or restrictions.\nIdentity: This shows your basic ID info — name, address, and signature.\nProof of age: This view shows that you’re over 18. It won’t show your exact age or date of birth. \nIn addition, the app is protected by the security features of your phone, including biometrics such as thumb or face scan. When first logging in to the myVicRoads app, you'll also need to switch on two-step verification and set a unique pin code. These additional protections ensure that logging into your myVicRoads account is secure (even if your username and password are compromised). \n\nIf you lose your physical licence, you can still access your licence via your phone.\n\nWe have tested both apps using stringent security and penetration tests. We will keep testing the app after the digital licence has been released."

All Victorians are still required to have a physical licence so if you've lost your physical licence card, you will still need to order a replacement licence.\n \nWhen you replace your licence, the licence number stays the same but the additional security card number changes, which helps prevent previous licence information from being used fraudulently. Your card number is found on the back of your new card and is automatically updated in your digital driver licence."

        "Question": "What is the process to register a vehicle?",
        "Answer": "To register a vehicle in Victoria, you first need to check your eligibility: individuals must be at least 16 years old to register a light vehicle and 18 years old for a heavy vehicle, while companies and incorporated associations must provide an ACN or ARBN. Begin by obtaining a Certificate of Roadworthiness (RWC), unless the vehicle is brand new and has never been registered in Australia. Next, book a registration appointment with VicRoads, ensuring you bring the vehicle (if an inspection is required), a completed vehicle registration form, proof of identity, an RWC (if applicable), and evidence of your Victorian garage address. If someone else is handling the registration, they will need an original and signed Authority to Act as an Agent form. During the appointment, you will also need tools to attach your number plates and payment for registration fees, which include the standard registration charge, number plate fee, Transport Accident Commission charge, and motor vehicle duty (if applicable). If you are using previous number plates or custom plates, additional fees may apply."

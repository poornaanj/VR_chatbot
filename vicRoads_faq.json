        "Question": "How secure is a digital driver licence?\n",
        "Answer": "The security of your private information is our top priority. Your digital driver licence will be secure in the app. It can only be seen by you and whoever you choose to share it with. To protect your privacy, you decide if you want to share all - or just some - of your licence data. You control the personal information you share with licence verifiers based on why you are using it. \nThere are 3 levels of info that you can share with your digital driver licence:\nFull licence: This view shows info about your right to drive. You can share this view when you need to show police things like licence status, classes, or restrictions.\nIdentity: This shows your basic ID info — name, address, and signature.\nProof of age: This view shows that you’re over 18. It won’t show your exact age or date of birth. \nIn addition, the app is protected by the security features of your phone, including biometrics such as thumb or face scan. When first logging in to the myVicRoads app, you'll also need to switch on two-step verification and set a unique pin code. These additional protections ensure that logging into your myVicRoads account is secure (even if your username and password are compromised). \n\nIf you lose your physical licence, you can still access your licence via your phone.\n\nWe have tested both apps using stringent security and penetration tests. We will keep testing the app after the digital licence has been released."

All Victorians are still required to have a physical licence so if you've lost your physical licence card, you will still need to order a replacement licence.\n \nWhen you replace your licence, the licence number stays the same but the additional security card number changes, which helps prevent previous licence information from being used fraudulently. Your card number is found on the back of your new card and is automatically updated in your digital driver licence."
